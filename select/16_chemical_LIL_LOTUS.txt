I'm kinda sad but I kinda make money though
And I got friends but I like to spend my time alone
It's nothing personal
It's just the chemicals
It's just the chemical
And I can't let it go

I'm kinda sad but I kinda make money though
And I got friends but I like to spend my time alone
It's nothing personal
It's just the chemicals
It's just the chemical
And I can't let it go

It's nothing personal, it just hurts though
And I always knew I spend a lot of time alone
It's nothing personal, I just can't get physical
I'm touching money though, I get so emotional
But then act so emotionless
Tried to climb out of this pit, but it's bottomless
And I can't even focus
Long enough, to keep you in my focus

No, I can't even focus
Lost every chance I had to get better, I'm feeling hopeless
And I just hope you know it
Yeah, I just hope you know it

It's just the chemical
I made a habit out of you and I can't let it go
Just the chemical
You made a habit out me too so just pick up your phone

And I got friends but I like to spend my time alone
It's nothing personal
It's just the chemicals
It's just the chemical
And I can't let it go
